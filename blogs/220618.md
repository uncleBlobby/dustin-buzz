Today is the day folks, we are T minus zero to launch time.

After a good while messing with javascript/html/css, a couple university classes on programming and learning computer science, a number of half-finished personal projects, and about eighteen months overall of more-or-less self-directed learning, we are finally at a stage where deploying our personal site has become priority numero uno.

Enter [NextJS](https://nextjs.org).

NextJS is a framework I have heard of in the past, mentioned on tech forums, coder blogs, and brilliant job ads for local and global tech start-ups.

What on Earth is it?

According to the official documentation, NextJS is "the React Framework for Production". It offers "the best" experience for a developer and all kinds of features which I haven't even got to learn yet.

...

I have been learning a little bit of React, since it seems to be one of the most in-demand technologies on the job boards. I don't necessarily know enough about it to be 100% confident building a SPA for a paying client, but I am getting somewhere.

I have started to wrap my head around functional components, state, and using hooks to manage data. I've even begun work on putting together a couple full-stack applications (check on my github, here) using React for the front-end, and the ViteJS framework to help scaffold the development environment.

...

For a while, though, I thought React was a framework? Then I staretd to hear about frameworks vs. libraries, and what differences the two bring to the table. Turns out, at the front-end feast, the table is full of options.

Follow along with me as I continue to poke around NextJS and learn to use it more effectively as a tool to showcase my progress and document my journey.

Bye for now!
