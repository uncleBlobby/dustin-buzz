Today is also the day, for some reason, that I decided it was time to go running again.

And by running, I mean jogging.  And by jogging, I mean a combination of running and walking that kind of averages out to something like jogging.  I think.  As yet, there's no way in heck I'm going to run anywhere near as far nor as fast as Forrest Gump.  But that doesn't stop me from wanting to try, to try to do what I can.  And on top of that, to do a little better than I did last time.

It's been nearly 2 years since the last time I went 'jogging'.  I've done a lot of walking in the meanwhile, and some trail-hiking, but nothing on the order of running or even jogging.  I tend to average around 10,000 steps a day on the regular days of the week, just moving around at work.  Occasionally on the weekend I'll go out and deliberately walk 4 or 5 km, but not as often as I'd like.

The reason that I kinda gave up on jogging so long ago was because the last time I did it (Fall 2020) I wound up injuring my heel.  I'm not sure what I did -- funnily enough, that morning was the first time I ever really did some "stretching" before I went out.  Maybe improper stretching contributed to the cause.  I also think I pushed myself a little harder than normal that day, maybe, but I never did make it to 5k.

After that "injury" I walked with a limp for at least a couple weeks and my foot felt like a dead weight swinging from the end of my leg.

I didn't want to go through that again, so I cooled it for a while.  It was wintertime soon enough, and I told myself I'd try get back into it the next warm season.

Well, the next warm season came and gone, and I didn't get up to much jogging.  In fact, if I can recall correctly, I didn't get up to any at all.  I did do a bit of hiking, and fairly regular walking, but nothing with any degree of intensity.  Nothing where my heart rate might escalate and push my body outside of it's regular comfort zone.

But today, 32 degrees Celsius, seemed like a good day to try again.  So I went out here, just before supper, and ran a few loops around the neighbourhood. In 2022 I had been using an app called "Couch 2 5k" in order to help myself train toward a goal, and I just picked up where I left off.  Week 2, day 2.

...

And, you know what?

...

It felt pretty good--it *still feels* pretty good as I sit here and type this, cigarette in hand.  I only managed just under 4km, and it took me a hair over 30 minutes.. but that's about 8:30 minutes per kilometer (compared to my normal walking pace of 11 or 12) and about 7 or 7.5 km/hr.  Not bad!

With any luck, before too long, I will be out there again.
