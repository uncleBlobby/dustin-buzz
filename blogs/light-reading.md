I like to spend time in the library.  Usually, the [Archer Library at the University of Regina](https://www.uregina.ca/library/?full).  Actually, I am not very familiar with the Regina Public Libraries... I should make a point of checking them out, too.  I still have a membership card from ages ago -- I wonder if it's still valid?

*Ahh.. my old stomping grounds.*

Yesterday I took a stroll through the Archer Library again.  It is eerily quiet on a summer Saturday but, then again, it is a library.  And it's a Saturday in the heat of summer.  Probably not too surprising.

I had went in with the intent of returning one of the books I had borrowed a couple weeks ago, and never really got into.  Meanwhile, I was going to browse some of the books on video game design -- since, now I am at a point in my learning journey I feel capable of starting to create a video game, which has always been a dream of mine.  However, now that I am at this point -- I am fresh out of ideas.  It's a bit weird... more on that later.

Using the online library directory is easy enough, but I find it a bit clunky on mobile.  After a bit of googling, I managed to come across a listing for ["The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses"](https://www.amazon.ca/Art-Game-Design-Lenses-Second/dp/1466598646) by one [Jesse Schell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Schell).  It had some positive reviews, so I followed the listing to the 4th floor and lost myself down one of the aisles.  Before getting right to my target, I stumbled on this:

![lisp-book](/images/lisp-book.jpg)

For some reason I am fascinated by the [LISP programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)).  Though I haven't the slightest idea what it's about -- I've never yet tried to use it, or even read much about it in any detail.  One day I will, though.. maybe even today? 

*Adds "Learn LISP" to list of to-dos.*

Right around this curiously-coloured LISP title, there laid shelf after shelf of selections dedicated to all the classic programming languages I've read about.  Books on C, C++, Cobol, Prolog, Fortran, and a whole shwack of books on Java.  I couldn't help but feel a bit in awe at the number of options, and overwhelmed.  

Most of these books probably hadn't been touched in years, but there they stood -- eagerly waiting to be picked up, flipped through, learned from, and eventually shelved again.

I moved on, trying to stay on task, and found the book I had came to find.

![game-design-book-of-lenses](/images/game-design-lenses-cover.png)

["The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses", Jesse Schell](https://www.amazon.ca/Art-Game-Design-Lenses-Second/dp/1466598646)

My motivation here is relatively simple: maybe if I read a bit about what makes *good game design*, I'll find some inspiration in trying to come up with a game of my own.  Right now I have all kinds of ideas bubbling in the back of my mind, the cumulative result of nearly three decades of experience, but I find it difficult to settle and commit on the particulars--and I tend to fall victim to what folks call "[scope creep](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/top-five-causes-scope-creep-6675)", before even getting started.

That's just fine, I'm learning as I go and grateful for it.

While I was there I sent a DM to my friend and mentor, asking whether they had any titles to recommend.  They've got a pretty good idea of where I'm at in my journey, here, and generally offer advice on where to poke around next.  I appreciate that a lot, so, if you're reading this: thanks again.

Of course they recommended learning more about databases, specifically postresql.  I am at a point now where I have figured out, if only superficially, how a database is supposed to work.. and I have made effective use of them a couple of times.. but my strategy has been mostly improvised.  

So I agreed.  Unfortunately, I was unable to find any postgres-specific materials at the Archer, but I did find the database section that had ample offerings.  Most of them published in the late 80s or early 90s, which seems a bit dated now.  But how much have databases really changed over the years?  

I don't know, yet.  But I'll learn a bit more about that as I go.  I settled on this:

![database-design-and-implementation](/images/database-design-cover.png)

["Database Design and Implementation", Edward Sciore](https://www.amazon.ca/Database-Design-Implementation-Edward-Sciore/dp/0471757160)

The motivation here is twofold: one, getting a better birds-eye view on the theory behind RDMS, and two, getting a better handle on the specifics involved.  The terminology, the concepts, and the standard practices involved in administering and maintaining relational databases in general.  In regards to my career plan, this I think is going to be a highly employable skill to hone.

I started flipping through the pages yesterday after getting home, and it looks like exactly what I need.  If I make it through the whole thing, take some notes, do some practice, I think it will be an especially valuable resource.  

Even if I don't, whatever I do absorb won't hurt.

Before I left, I picked up a couple other titles:

![design-for-hackers](/images/design-for-hackers-cover.png)

["Design for Hackers: Reverse Engineering Beauty", David Kadavy](https://www.amazon.ca/Design-Hackers-Reverse-Engineering-Beauty/dp/1119998956)

I picked this up because I have recently found myself interested in the field of user interface and user experience.  What applications I have come up with to date, however functional or not they may be, usually come with a clunky UI -- even though I am improving and notice clear changes now from when I just started.  I figure it doesn't hurt to learn a bit from the experts, and see what other points of view may be out there.

And I also found this gem, which I think may be my favourite out of the whole haul:

![code-craft](/images/code-craft-cover.png)

["Code Craft: The Practice of Writing Excellent Code", Pete Goodliffe](https://www.amazon.ca/Code-Craft-Practice-Writing-Excellent/dp/1593271190/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3RJMSAD4ULLF4&keywords=code+craft&qid=1656260027&s=books&sprefix=code+craft%2Cstripbooks%2C95&sr=1-1)

This hefty tome is a general purpose repository of advice for anyone looking to write better code.  I've gone through the first two chapters so far, and the content is insightful and not too preachy.  I look forward to what the rest of the chapters might show.  

Even though I am a beginner, I feel like I have written a lot of bad code -- sometimes, maybe even most of the time, I go back to an old project and I have a very hard time coming to terms with what's going on.  It isn't always spaghetti, but even when it is I don't always have the stomach for it.
